		<h2> background </h2>

		<p> In August 2015, the BC Ministry of Education announced that they would be overhauling the Kindergarten-Grade 9 curriculum. Instead of encouraging teachers to have their students complete prescribed learning outcomes and measure competency using student achievement levels, the new curriculum focused on exploring big ideas. Upon release of the curriculum documentation on <a href = "http://curriculum.gov.bc.ca">curriculum.gov.bc.ca</a>, teachers were tasked to learn the new curriculum and explain the changes to students and parents, but both teachers and families found the documentation too vague and difficult to parse through.</p>

		<h2> challenge </h2>

		<p> I proposed to develop a visual guide for teachers and families to learn and reference the new BC K-9 curriculum based on big ideas. After interviewing the elementary teachers at Ascend Online (an independent K-12 distance learning school in Kamloops, BC), including Mary Gallagher, the K-9 Coordinator, the visual guide had to be in a rollable A2 (23.4 in x 16.5 inches) poster format so it can be easily transported and given away to families. </p>

		<h2> role </h2>

		<p> As an Instructional Design Assistant at Ascend Online, I worked with Mary Gallagher in converting her summary report of big ideas for teachers to a visual language that was easy for parents and students to understand. From then on, I was responsible for sketching the graphical layout of the poster on paper and designing it on Adobe Photoshop. </p>

		<h2> ideation </h2>

		<h3> sketches </h3>

		<p> I began the project by sketching multiple graphical layouts of the poster, playing around with the amount of columns and different orientations. What I found difficult during this stage (which carried into the Execution stage) was predicting the fit and readability of the text. I had to fit nine academic subjects and their big ideas per grade onto this poster, all of which had varying word counts. </p>

		<p> Eventually I decided to go with a 9 x 9 grid layout with a full width header. </p>

		<h2> execution </h2>

		<p> During this stage, the typographical and colour choices were driven by making the content modern (considering the curriculum change was new to many) and readability. The final poster was made using Adobe Photoshop. </p>

		<img class = "graphic" src="./img/4/big ideas_poster_chec.jpg"/>

		<h2> results </h2>

		<p> Upon circulating the poster to Mary Gallagher and the K-9 teaching team, each of them printed and laminated the poster to show families during home visits. During these visits, Mary was approached by a representative from CISVA (Catholic Independent Schools Vancouver Archdiocese) to start circulating the poster to elementary schools in the Lower Mainland. Later, after another teacher from a larger distance learning school in BC saw a family's personal copy of the poster in their home, it was used to train their own elementary school teachers about the new curriculum. In April 2017, a couple hundred posters were given away during <a href = "https://bcconvention.ca/">BC CHEC</a> (Christian Home Educators Convention and Trade Show) tradeshow.</p>
