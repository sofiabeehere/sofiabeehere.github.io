		<h2> background </h2>

		<p> This web application was my final project for IAT 352 (Internet Computing Technologies), an upper division undergraduate course which introduced back-end languages and concepts like PHP, MySQL, Ajax/JSON, and database administration through XAMPP. Using my professional background as an instructional designer in the K-12 school system, I wanted to create a web application that can be used by school administration to manage and store admission applications and the personal information of students, families, and teachers. </p>

		<h2> challenge </h2>

		<p> My challenge for this project was being completely new to PHP, MySQL, Ajax/JSON, XAMPP and databases in general, so it was important for me to grasp a thorough understanding of those languages and concepts first before starting the project. It was also difficult for me in duration of this project to always prioritize back-end functionality over front-end appearance while meeting the project criteria and time constraints set by the instructor. </p>

		<h2> role </h2>

		<p> This academic project was individual, so I conducted the background research, designed the database schema, and coded both the front- and back-end side of the web application on my own. </p>

		<h2> ideation </h2>

		<h3> research </h3>

		<p> As a stepping stone, I initially used first-hand experience from Ascend Online's (the school I work at as an Instructional Design Assistant) own student information system (SIS), Genius, and learning management system (LMS), Moodle, as points of reference to get me to start thinking about how this web application should (or shouldn't) function. </p>

		<p> To know more about what form fields are typically found on a K-12 admissions application, I obtained a copy from school administration. In addition, while I was taking this course at the time, there were many instances during staff meetings when staff members would express their frustrations about the current SIS and wanted to change to a different SIS. I took note of these frustrations and conducted follow-up surveys through email with individuals who were most vocal during the meetings. Using their comments and the answers I received through the surveys, I made <a href = "./img/3/cerulean personas.pdf">two brief personas</a> to help me shape a supposed target audience.

	<h2> execution </h2>

	<p> I followed the <a href = "https://www.testingexcellence.com/incremental-model/">incremental software development process</a> (planning and design using project requirements, implementation, testing/verification, and maintenance) as I completed this project. Upon receiving the requirements of the project, I submitted a <a href = "./img/3/proposal.pdf">proposal</a> which laid out the features of my web application. Using both the proposal and database schema diagram, my implementation plan was as follows:</p>

	<p><i style = "font-weight: bold;">Step 1</i> - Using HTML/CSS and PHP, code information (i.e. text-only) pages and admissions form.<p>
	<p><i style = "font-weight: bold;">Step 2</i> - Build database using MySQL to start collecting information submitted through admissions form, which can be viewed using phpMyAdmin (included in XAMPP).</p>
	<p><i style = "font-weight: bold;">Step 3</i> - Relay student and teacher information throughout web application by reading the relevant database(s) using a combination of PHP and MySQL, which the users themselves can edit by logging into the application.</p>
	
	<p>After completing each step, I would test out the functionality of the feature(s) and validate the information flowing through the application and its database. Once I ensure that the feature(s) functions the way I described in my proposal while following project requirements, it is only then I can move onto the next step of implementation.</p>

	<p>From the user's point of view, their experience upon first visiting the web application would as follows:</p>

	<!-- [slideshow/lightbox of web application screenshots with the following as captions:] -->
	<div class="wireframes">
			<div>
				<a href="http://placehold.it/700x450" data-caption = "test">
					<img src="http://placehold.it/700x450"/>
				</a>
				<p>1. Visit the "Admissions" tab to fill out a new student application. From there, they can enter their personal information, contact details of both the student and their guardian(s), and the courses the student wishes to take. If they leave out required fields, warnings will appear to fill them out before the form is submitted to school administration.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<a href="http://placehold.it/700x450">
					<img src="http://placehold.it/700x450"/>
				</a>
				<p> 2. Once they successfully fill out and submit the application, they will receive a unique username and temporary password to login to their account, asking them to login promptly to change their password. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<a href="http://placehold.it/700x450">
					<img src="http://placehold.it/700x450"/>
				</a>
				<p> 3. Using the temporary login details, they can login and view the courses they have signed up for, as well as change their username and password. </p>

	<p>Additional features listed in my proposal such as the messaging system, viewing/editing grades for students and teachers respectively, and a couple more had to unfortunately be omitted due to recommendations voiced by my TA and instructor, whom both said that those features fall outside the scope and difficulty level of the course and would distract me from meeting project criteria. In other words, they wanted me to focus on showing that I can successfully implement the key functionalities they were looking for (admissions form, login, and changing account information) instead and as my superiors in charge of grading my deliverables, I followed their advice. Nevertheless, they appreciated my effort in trying to challenging myself and the unique rationale behind my application. </p>

	<h2> results </h2>

	<p> When I completed this project, I gained a better understanding of back-end web development, so in the near future, I want to improve my skills further by learning the necessary frameworks/libraries needed to implement the omitted features and revisit this application. It is also worth mentioning that I received a 100 percent for my final project and an overall grade of A for the course.  </p>

	<p> The formal technical reports I submitted with this project at the end of step 2 and 3 describes the programming challenges I had during development, as well as possible opportunities for improvement in further detail. Both can be downloaded below: </p>
