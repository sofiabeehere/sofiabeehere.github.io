	<h1> PORTFOLIO WEBSITE </h1>

		<h2> background </h2>

		<p> As I start to apply for co-op positions, I took it upon myself to start designing my own personal branding and a portfolio website, which I coded by hand. This portfolio website aims to showcase both academic and professional projects I took part in, ranging from graphic design, UI/UX design, web development, and instructional design. </p>

		<h2> challenge </h2>

		<p> Although I was already well-versed in HTML and CSS, to simulate responsiveness, I had to familiarize myself with JavaScript (particularly jQuery). Before this project, I only had a shallow understanding of JavaScript and jQuery, so I had to read and understand various printed and online resources during the project to increase my fluency. </p>

		<h2> role </h2>

		<p> I was the primary designer and web developer for this project. Initially, I sketched out potential logos and layouts digitally and then used Axure RP to create wireframes for the website. Meanwhile, my personal logo was developed using Adobe Illustrator, while I used Sublime Text as a code editor for my portfolio website. </p>

		<h2> ideation </h2>

		<p> I started this project by sketching possible logos for my personal branding. I wanted to develop a brand that encapsulated my aspirations as a designer that loves to program. In some way, I used the idiom "package deal" as inspiration for my final logo, with each aspect of myself represented through a pentagon - the colourful gold one symbolizing my "designer" side, the monochrome one symbolizing my austere "programmer" side, tied together using a script font of my initials "SB". </p>

		<p> Using the message conveyed in my final logo, I started sketching possible layouts for my website. Instead of having a common top navigation bar, driven by the principle that people read from left to right, I wanted to have my navigation as a left sidebar. The portfolio entries would then be laid out as a 3-column grid, which would collapse into a 2-column grid on tablets and 1-column on mobile phones. Upon clicking one of the portfolio entries, a modal box describing the experience would pop-up. </p>

		<h2> execution </h2>

		<p> I took my final logo sketch and created it on Adobe Illustrator. The colour scheme started from a golden-brown colour combining an earthy brown from package wrapping paper and my personal preference for gold, along with the timeless pair of black and white. </p>

		<p> As for my portfolio website, as I started developing it, I changed many of my initial design decisions: </p>

		<ul>

			<li> Instead of the modal box for every portfolio entry, I reserved separate pages with a redirect button for each one, because the modal box was very dense looking and thus limited the amount of content I can include for each entry. </li>
			<li> 	After receiving feedback from my co-op advisor, instead of a single-line title banner for each portfolio entry image appearing on hover, a white box with the title of the portfolio entry and the design domain it belonged to. </li>
			<li> 	The filter feature originally was a dropdown in the sidebar, but was moved to the top of the portfolio entry images for better visibility and relevancy. </li>

		</ul>

		<h2> results </h2>

		<p> At many times, especially when I was considering if I should deviate from my initial wireframes, I was internally struggling between <i> aesthetic flair </i> versus <i> simplicity and functionality </i>. In the end, I always chose simplicity and functionality because I wanted to make sure users of my website could easily find, read, and understand my portfolio and its entries, as well as get a sense of what my priorities are when I am designing and developing a website. </p>
